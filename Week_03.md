## Assessment
This week has been the most challenging so far. There is a new team to work with, which means readjusting the team structure. New roles, this week I was the UX/UI. New topics, we used Node + Express + 2 APIs I never used before.
____
Starting from TypeScript and Execute Program, I find this language slighlty more complicated than JavaScript, but it makes bugs less of a problem, which turns the starting difficulty to an enjoyment. 
____
I completed the Ts Basics EP course and started the Everyday Ts course, currently at 13%.
____
I learned about Obsidian, and started taking detailed soft dev notes on all the new things I learn, dividing my notes by programming languages, resources, etc.. + I am using hastags on the beginning of each note to link information as you can see on this image, the tags create the linked universe you can see on the right of the screen, so I can select REACT and see all the related info.

____
I learned about POSTMAN and INSOMNIA, although I did not download them or used them, but I understand what is their purpose.
____
I did learn JIRA and how to use it. Also Cypress basic logics. ESLint, prettier. Basic React. Console logs. Debugging. Chrome Dev Tools. RESTful APIs. cURL commands. Testing. Plus other minor things.
____
I also did all the code reviews on EP for the previous courses, every single day, so that I keep memorising and cementing the previous weeks concepts in my mind.

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
Something I struggled with is not code related, it is managing the working time (the time we are at FAC space4 office) to complete the project. 
____
This week was the first time I wasn't able to complete my tasks by Thursday (like I did in my previous 2 projects), but I did have a bigger workload.
____
I did a lot more pair programming and I either helped or received help from my colleagues. 
____
Secondly I started writing my Obsidian notes which makes things a little slower, but it is helping me a lot to memorise concepts because I read them first, I try to understand them, I re-write them in my notes and by the time these 3 steps have gone I feel much more prepared on the topic.
____
I chose to not do extra hours outside of the set 36 hours, mainly because I work weekends, so I need the evenings to rest, do gym, have a little social life and keep my mental health stable. Today is my 30th day in a row with no days off, with a couple more months to go, meaning I am at 1/4 of my September to December 20th 7/7 working days, and I don't feel overly tired or stressed, which is great. 
____
On another side this means I wasn't able to complete my tasks during the working hours, so it might be that I will do some extra working hours soon or ask my colleagues to take over some parts of the project if they have more time. This is something I feel good about, the team is very supportive and we are good at helping each other.
