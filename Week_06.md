## Assessment
This week I improved greatly my PR Requests, commits, documentation, code readability.
I have also continued with Exectute Program. I am currently doing 2 courses: SQL and Everyday TypeScript.

Will and Jack set the back-end and front-end server and when they did the initial setting, they also automated or implemented a standard way of doing PR Requests, commit messages, updating README.md file and folder structure. 
This led to an amazingly organised use og Git, which makes life so much easier for me to check my colleagues code, finding all the answers to understand what they have done without having to ask them and loose time.

Making our Zubi project mobile first and responsive. It can be time consuming at the beginning of the project, but it is an absolute blessing later in the project because now our website is looking great!
