## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
This week was mostly connecting the LOGIN and LOGOUT front and backend and learning authentication. I do need more time to learn it, it is not something that I could do easily just yet.

One thing that I improved this week is time and stress management, I do not have any code do copy and paste here for that skill. I managed to focus on an MVP with my team and achieve it, which is something I haven't done in any of my previous projects and led to some sort of stress. 

I am improving my commits, PR requests, going on with Execute Program and taking more notes on Obsidian.

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
I am struggling with Authentication in general, especially now we managed to connect the LOGIN front and backend, but we haven't managed to connect the LOGOUT, although it is working on the backend already. I have to take charge of the SIGNUP, this will be my struggle for the weekend.
